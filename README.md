In Sweden, health -conscinousness and a desire for informed food choices are on the rise.

Our app Matkollen address this growing need by providing a user-friendly platform that gives detailed nutrition information for various food products. 

Our unique idea lies in allowing the users to set their preferences, such as food allergies, diet conscious and dietary restrictions.

This means that if a user is allergic to certain ingredients or wants to avoid sugar, the app will flag food containing those items, empowering them to make healthier decisions effortlessely.

The app's key feature include a comprehensive food database with detailed information on carbohydrates, fats, proteins as well as over 50 other nutrients such as Kalcium, Zinc, Vitamin D etc. 

It also integrates with a localized Swedish food database to ensure the informaton is relevant and practical for users. This database is updated daily.
